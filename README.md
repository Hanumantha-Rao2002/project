# File Integrity Monitor 

Here's a detailed outline for a File Integrity Monitor project, covering different levels of complexity:

**Project Goal:** To create a tool that monitors files for unauthorized changes by calculating and comparing file hashes.

**Basic Version (Command-Line Tool - Python):**

*   **Functionality:**
    *   Takes a directory as input.
    *   Calculates the hash (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) of each file in the directory.
    *   Stores the file paths and their corresponding hashes in a file (e.g., `hashes.txt` or `hashes.json`).
    *   On subsequent runs, recalculates the hashes and compares them to the stored hashes.
    *   Reports any files that have been modified (hash mismatch), added (new file), or deleted (missing hash).
*   **Implementation (Python Example):**

```python
import hashlib
import os
import json

def calculate_hash(filepath):
    hasher = hashlib.sha256() # You can change the hash algorithm
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
            while True:
                chunk = file.read(4096)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                hasher.update(chunk)
        return hasher.hexdigest()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None

def monitor_directory(directory, hash_file="hashes.json"):
    try:
        with open(hash_file, 'r') as f:
            stored_hashes = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        stored_hashes = {}

    current_hashes = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
      filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
      if os.path.isfile(filepath): #check if it is a file
        current_hashes[filepath] = calculate_hash(filepath)

    modified = []
    added = []
    removed = []

    for filepath, current_hash in current_hashes.items():
        if filepath not in stored_hashes:
            added.append(filepath)
        elif stored_hashes[filepath] != current_hash:
            modified.append(filepath)

    for filepath in stored_hashes:
        if filepath not in current_hashes:
            removed.append(filepath)

    with open(hash_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(current_hashes, f, indent=4)

    if modified or added or removed:
        print("Changes detected:")
        if modified:
            print("Modified:", modified)
        if added:
            print("Added:", added)
        if removed:
            print("Removed:", removed)
    else:
        print("No changes detected.")

# Example usage
directory_to_monitor = "." # Current directory
monitor_directory(directory_to_monitor)
```

*   **Improvements for the Basic Version:**
    *   Use a more robust file format for storing hashes (like JSON or a database).
    *   Handle exceptions more gracefully (e.g., file permissions errors).
    *   Add command-line arguments for specifying the directory to monitor and the hash algorithm.

**Intermediate Version (GUI Application - Python with Tkinter/PyQt):**

*   **Functionality:**
    *   All the features of the basic version.
    *   Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
    *   Option to select multiple directories to monitor.
    *   Real-time monitoring (periodically check for changes).
    *   Display changes in a user-friendly format in the GUI.
    *   Logging of changes to a file.
*   **Implementation:** Use a GUI framework like Tkinter (simpler) or PyQt (more powerful) in Python to create the interface.
*   **Additional features:**
    *   Alerts (e.g., pop-up notifications or email alerts) when changes are detected.
    *   Exclusion lists (specify files or directories to ignore).

**Advanced Version (Cross-Platform with Advanced Features):**

*   **Functionality:**
    *   All the features of the intermediate version.
    *   Cross-platform compatibility (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Integration with system logging (e.g., Windows Event Log, syslog).
    *   Centralized management (monitor multiple systems from a single location).
    *   Advanced reporting and analysis of changes.
    *   Integration with other security tools (e.g., SIEM systems).
*   **Implementation:** Consider using a cross-platform framework like Qt (C++) or Electron (JavaScript) for the GUI.
*   **Further Enhancements:**
    *   Digital signatures: Verify the integrity of files using digital signatures.
    *   Remote monitoring: Monitor files on remote systems.
    *   Database integration: Store hashes and logs in a database for better performance and scalability.
    *   Anomaly detection: Use machine learning techniques to detect unusual changes that might indicate a security breach.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Hash Algorithm:** Choose a strong cryptographic hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3. MD5 and SHA-1 are considered weak and should be avoided.
*   **Storage of Hashes:** Store the hashes securely. Do not store them in plain text. Consider using a database or encrypting the storage file.
*   **Performance:** For large directories, calculating hashes can be time-consuming. Consider optimizing the code and using multithreading or multiprocessing.
*   **Resource Usage:** Real-time monitoring can consume system resources. Optimize the monitoring frequency to balance performance and responsiveness.

This detailed breakdown should give you a good starting point for your File Integrity Monitor project. Remember to start with the basic version and gradually add more features as you progress.
